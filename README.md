Sadly, the assignments and class are in norwegian, and this tends to cause me to write half-norwegian code, so this might not be the most readable code-base for non-norwegians

Languages: C++17 and Python 3.6.5

Some criticism welcome i suppose, but these are usually not intended to be anything like perfect.

Each folder is a single assignment. The Assignment folder contains the assignment itself.

C++ code has CMakeLists. to compile:
```
mkdir cmake
cd cmake
cmake ..
make
```
for python, just:

`python3 [filename]`
